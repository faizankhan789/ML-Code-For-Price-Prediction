# ML-Code-For-Price-Prediction
Trained  models for each car using seven different algorithms, including  Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, SVR, Lasso, and Ridge, evaluating  them based on metrics such as RÂ² score, mean squared error, and  mean absolute error. Selected the best-performing model through  Bayesian Optimization and K-Fold Cross-Validation.
